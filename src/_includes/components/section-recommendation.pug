          | Hey guys! Last year I decided to open my own IT Academy.

          | I needed a website that would have a minimalist design, and at same time stood out from competitors' websites.
          br
          br
          | I contacted the BEETROOTERS Team to solve my case.

          | The BEETROOTERS Team has developed the coolest site, as for me. Minimalistic design, well-chosen colors and excellent drawings.
